# Python Language

Follow PEP8, allow up to 120 characters per line
Function definitions should use type hints, except when return None

# Coding Style

Do not add comments if the code is obvious
Code should be self-explanatory as much as possible
Prefer simplicity over complexity
Functions should be 20 lines or less

# Testing

Use the unittest framework for unit tests
Each test should test one specific behavior
Don't just test the happy path

# Adding new functionality

Do not change existing functionality unless asked to
Do not clean up, or improve the code unless asked to
Concentrate on solving the specific task
Feel free to ask for clarification if the task is not clear
