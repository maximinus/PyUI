Our aim is to make enough GUI to build an IDE.

To not get side-tracked, we need to build towards this rather than anything else.
This means that, at a minimum, we need to solve the following:

1: We need drop-down menus
2: We need a text widget
3: The window must be re-sizeable
4: We need to be able to produce a new window
5: We need to get fonts from the system and use them
6: We need a file selector
7: We need a tree widget
8: We need to have a scrollable box widget
9: We need a widget model that responds to events
10: Other widgets: Checkbox, Drop-down menu, text input, splitter, tabs, icon, button


Plan
----

* Get a single menu displaying
* Connect that to a menubar
* Get the mouse working with a connection to the menu items
* Add actions to the system to handle callbacks
5: Allow the window to be resized
6: Add a text editor widget
7: Allow editing of text
8: Add a file manager to the lhs; include a splitter widget
9: Fill in the menus
10: Add search / replace
11: Add allowing to make an extra window
12: Allow saving and loading
13: Add tabs to the text editor


Current Work and Latest:

Clean up the base widget as according to the new spec
Make a button widget that has mouse over and click images
Render this example as the ColorRect code
Update the other widgets to fall in line with this code
Re-vist the mouse menu and use the same code to make that work
Finish the mouse-menu


Window can be resized
* Menus look ok
* Basic text widget added.


Phase 2
-------

At this point, we start to move to Lisp.
