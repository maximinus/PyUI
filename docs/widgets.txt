Basics
======

A widget doesn't usually have a fixed size. For example:

    A text widget renders text, and that's all. So its size depends on the text.
    The same for a button. It's some extra space for the button image, but the size is text dependant.
    Same for text entry boxes, menu drop downs and so on

This does mean that the HEIGHT of anything with text requires that the every line of text is the same height.


Boxes
=====

Now let's look at a box.

The job of a box is to contain other widgets. A box itself may expand or not, as may the widgets.
A box will be given a certain size to fit into. The logic is:

When a widget is passed a given size, it can either expand or not.
If it can expand:
    The widget will return a size that is the maximum allocated
Otherwise:
    The widget will return a size that is equal to or smaller than the given size
    If any widget is set to expand, then the size returned will be equal to the given size
