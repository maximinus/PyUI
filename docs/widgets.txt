Basics
======

Widget sizes are important, usually fixed

    A text widget renders text, and that's all. So its size depends on the text.
    The same for a button. It's some extra space for the button image, but the size is text dependant.
    Same for text entry boxes, menu drop downs and so on
    If something is chaged

This does mean that the HEIGHT of anything with text requires that the every line of text is the same height.


Boxes
=====

Now let's look at a box.

The job of a box is to contain other widgets. A box itself may expand or not, as may the widgets.
A box will be given a certain size to fit into. The logic is:

When a widget is passed a given size, it can either expand or not.
If it can expand:
    The widget will return a size that is the maximum allocated
Otherwise:
    The widget will return a size that is equal to or smaller than the given size
    If any widget is set to expand, then the size returned will be equal to the given size
    A box can have a background.

A widget has a main method render(), that draws the widget.

A widget always renders to it's parents texture.
The top widget is always a root widget, which has no parent and a fixed size.
You can change the size of a root widget, on render the size is fixed and child widgets cannot expand beyond it.

A frame and a container make choices about the allocation of space to their child widgets.
Every widget has a min_size(), which reports the minimum size of the widget.
This is calculated by working out the smallest area we can be drawn in, and then adding any margin we have.

When a frame is rendered, it has a fixed size. It tells its child widget to render at this given size.
This widget is usually some form of box, and this widget can share the space it has with it's child widgets.
Child widgets that want to expand share any spare space (the size of the frame minus the combined min sizes).

Widgets also have a "fill" option. A parent widget is free to split space between.

When this aspace is allocated, a widget gets passed a size value, and a place to write it.
It should draw its widget given the space, and then render that on its parent.


Thoughts on rendering
=====================

Thw widget knows too much about it's parent.
Don't pass parent information down, do it the opposite way:
    A widget tells another widget to render itself. It does that it to its own texture.
    Once they are rendered, the parent widget will draw them itself to it's texture.
    This goes all the way to the frame, which still doesn't know the display.
    A widget will keep the sizes of the widgets, maybe as offsets from the origin.
    To test some collision, we start at the root frame and recurse through, updating the offset <-> screen

Thus, we ONLY need a simple "render" routine, and it simply needs a size.
We don't need to keep that size anywhere.

When a widget changes, it will render again with the same size as the previous time.
It wil then tell the main loop that a region is dirty.
That region is an offset from its own texture (so likely the very same size)
Now we cycle through all the containers. If a container has this rect it simply redraws that area to itself.
We do this from the tips to the root, so finally the frame is updated.
The main loop knows where the frames are, so it can do the same to the display.


Thoughts on spacing
===================

If an hbox has 300 width, how does it split that 3 ways?
Given that, how it possible for a fill option to exist?

For example, here is some current code:

    ColorRect(Size(50, 50), Color.RED, align=Align.CENTER, expand=Expand.NONE, fill=Expand.HORIZONTAL, background=(50, 50, 50))

So this widget is 50x50, so the box will just give it 50, right?
So if the total length of widgets is less than the frame size, just draw them linearly.
If the widgets have backgrounds there is a chance this is ugly; however anything could be made ugly.
    The solution is a spacer widget, or expand a widget. Having a fill option overcomplicates

Also, do we need to have children or not? I think a boolean "container" is a good idea can be a simple property
Thus, all containers need to be a common class, a simple "Container" which is itself a seperate class
A frame is a class that holds a single widget at a fixed side
A border is a frame with a decorative border


So we need to adapt:

    Strip out current rendering code and switch to a simple model.
    Remove the fill option.
    Change the calculation method in boxes.
    Remove render_rect, and passing the parent texture. Parents render from their children.
