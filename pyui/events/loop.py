# When a widget is created, it has a list of [event_type, callback] structures
# When a SDL event happens, we first of all look at what frames are on the screen
# In every PyUi app, each window consists of exactly one widget
# We drill down that widget to ask if it needs this event
# If it doesn't, we then drill UP to the widgets parent to see if it needs that event
# A widget can block events from rising up the menu, but not down
# Although it appears simple, there are issues:

# We like clean code that states our intentions, so we use "Clicked" and also test against a widgets position
# But then sometimes we want to catch the event "Not clicked" - an event that could be consumed by something else!
# perhaps we can add the idea of FOCUS
# this means a widget can have extra callbacks that are only used when it has focus
# One of those callbacks is "not clicked here". Is that the only event we would want?
# Only the widget with focus gets keyboard input???
# 2 widgets can have focus, they would be sent the same messages

# Edit: Event should signal intent, if extra code is required here thats fine

# Things can send events, it's not just the SDL events that cause this
# When things are done, we also raise an event
# As a GUI, we only look at key presses and mouse clicks for now
