# a widget always has:
# "expand", does the widget ask for as much space as possible?
# a "margin" around the widget
# "fill", whether the widget should expand into any extra space passed to it to render in
# "align", if the widget should be the left / middle / top / bottom of the free space
# a min_size: the smallest this widget can be
# a render_rect; the area where the widget was drawn to (this does not include the margin)
# a boolean "redraw" which lets us know the widget needs to be redrawn
# "parent" which is the parent widget, or None if the root
# a series of callbacks, which consist of the message to catch and the callback when this happens
# a property "children" which returns all children
