# Widget
#  expand:      does the widget ask for as much space as possible, or just the minimum?
#  margin:      the size of the margin around the widget
#  min_size:    the smallest size the widget could be, with its margin
#  align:       if there is more size than the min size, and we are not filling, where should we align the widget?
#  parent:      the parent widget, or None if the root
# callbacks:    array of [event, callback] ro capture events
# children:     returns an array of all children (no children - an empty array)
# texture:      the texture drawn. Includes the margin
# background:   a color that covers the whole of the rear of the image
# container:    A property that is True if this widget is a container for other widgets
# current_size: The Size of the widget on last draw, or Size(-1, -1) with no texture

# some functions:
# render:       draw yourself to this new place
